        <h3>
          Consultant, facilitator,  trainer, and coach.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I specialise in strengthening work relationships and breaking down silos in organisations. I work with teams and individuals to explore and enhance their leadership, teamwork, communication and culture change.
        </p>
        <p>
         I design (and deliver) multi-layered training programmes that can be made up of forums, action learning groups, workshops, one-to-one sessions and online content (i.e. e-learning).
